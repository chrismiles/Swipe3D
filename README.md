Swipe3D
=======

<https://github.com/chrismiles/Swipe3D>

Demo app from the OpenGL ES for iOS 5 talk by Chris Miles at Swipe Conference 2012.

<http://swipeconference.com.au/sessions#27-opengl-es-with-ios-5-part-2-rendering-a-masterpiece>

The app demonstrates how to implement some OpenGL ES effects using GLKit, such as:

* Rendering a skybox using GLKSkyboxEffect
* Rendering a reflection effect using GLKReflectionMapEffect
* Setting up a cubemap texture using GLKTextureInfo
* Drawing a mesh using indexed vertices and glDrawElements()

The sample app is universal and supports all orientations.
